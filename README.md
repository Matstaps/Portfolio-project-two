* I confirmed that this website was responsive across different devices using the Google Chrome devtools device toolbar.
* I confirm that this single page and contained sections, are readable, understandable and responsive.
* I performed some manual testing on various devices, including Windows Desktop, iPhone SE, iPad

### Bugs

* I can confirm that no bugs were detected upon deployment.

### Validator Testing

* HTML 

Upon validation using [W3C HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input), a warning advised that the hero-image was missing a header. This was resolved by adding a header and setting the CSS to display:none. Repeating the validation then confirmed there were no errors.

* CSS

No errors were found when passing through the [Jigsaw CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input).

* Accessibility

The colour scheme chosen was passed through the [Color Tool](https://m2.material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=0&primary.color=E65100&secondary.color=FFEB3B) website to check the color palette against accessibility.
I confirmed that color and fonts are accessible and easy to read by passing the website through Lighthouse in devtools.
