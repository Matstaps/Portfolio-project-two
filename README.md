# Project 2 - Fire, Water, Wood

## Overview

A link to the live website is provided [here](https://matstaps.github.io/Portfolio-project-two/).

Fire, Water, Wood is a simple website designed to demonstrate javascript functions within a web-based page. It is based on the popular Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The website contains a header to introduce the page, and second level header to provide the user's instructions, a button section to allow the user to make a selection, a choice section to show the user's and computer's choice, a score accumulator section, a display to alert the winner of the last round, some images of the corresponding elements and a footer section.

This website intends to allow the users to play a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors type game, facilitated by the functions of JavaScript. 

This site was written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Additional text styling was provided using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/about)

* CSS

On first pass through the validator, invalid display values were found in the button and image container divs. This was amended to remove these errors in [Jigsaw CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input).

The colour scheme chosen was passed through the [Color Tool](https://m2.material.io/) website to check the color palette against accessibility.
I confirmed that color and fonts are accessible and easy to read by passing the website through Lighthouse in devtools.
